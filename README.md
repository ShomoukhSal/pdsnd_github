### Project Title
Data Exploration on U.S. Bikeshare Database 

### Project Overview
I used this project as an opportunity to practice Python by exploring U.S. bikeshare system database for 3 U.S. cities: New York city, Chicago, and Washington.
So, to effectively analyze the descriptive statistics, IÃ•ve built code to import the data and answer key questions about the use of this system. 
Additionally, I've created a script that accepts raw input to create an interactive user experience to provide this information in the terminal.
